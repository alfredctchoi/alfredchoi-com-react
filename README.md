# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio website that will be an ongoing work in progress.  You can the back log of the items I am planning to add to the site [here](https://github.com/alfredctchoi/alfredchoi-com-react/projects/2).

The portfolio is a simple React application that was created with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).  The static build files are stored on an AWS S3 bucket and served through CloudFront.
